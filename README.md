## A formal analysis of OpenPGP's post-quantum public-key algorithm extension

OpenPGP is an open standard of the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) security program, a popular system used for encrypting and decrypting communications, preventing unwanted individuals from eavesdropping.

A post-quantum extension for the OpenPGP protocol (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-wussler-openpgp-pqc/02/) has been proposed and standardized by an IETF working group.

We conduct a formal analysis of this post-quantum extension.
